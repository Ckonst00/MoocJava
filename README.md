## About the course

Welcome to the University of Helsinki’s massive open online course (MOOC) on programming! This is an updated version of our popular course Object-Oriented Programming with Java.

Please note, that this is a legacy course. It is no longer possible to gain ECTS credits for completing the course. The course content is also no longer updated or maintained.

During this course, you will learn the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using our automatic testing service Test My Code.

Anyone can join - no previous programming knowledge is required.

Unlike many programming courses found online, ours is completely unabridged; the course’s scope and material are identical to our CS1 Introduction to Programming and Advanced Programming courses.

We use industry-grade tooling from day one. As such, the course is about programming in a real integrated development environment (IDE) instead of a browser or an educational IDE.
