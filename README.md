## About the course

Welcome to the University of Helsinki’s massive open online course (MOOC) on programming! This is an updated version of our popular course Object-Oriented Programming with Java.

Please note, that this is a legacy course. It is no longer possible to gain ECTS credits for completing the course. The course content is also no longer updated or maintained.

During this course, you will learn the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using our automatic testing service Test My Code.

Anyone can join - no previous programming knowledge is required.

Unlike many programming courses found online, ours is completely unabridged; the course’s scope and material are identical to our CS1 Introduction to Programming and Advanced Programming courses.

We use industry-grade tooling from day one. As such, the course is about programming in a real integrated development environment (IDE) instead of a browser or an educational IDE.

Part1
The first part of the course focuses on taking the plunge with programming and getting familiar with all the required tools.
In this part:

    1. Getting started with programming
    2. Printing
    3. Reading input
    4. Variables
    5. Calculating with numbers
    6. Conditional statements and conditional operation
    7. Programming in our society

Part 2

The second part of the material focuses on repetition in programs and on how to divide functionality into distinct units.
In this part:

    1. Recurring problems and patterns to solve them
    2. Repeating functionality
    3. More loops
    4. Methods and dividing the program into smaller parts
    5. End questionnaire

Part 3

The main themes in the third part of the course are adding information to list and array data structures, and handling information in string form.
In this part:

    1. Discovering errors
    2. Lists
    3. Arrays
    4. Using strings
    5. Summary

Part 4

The main theme of the fourth part is object-oriented programming. You will learn to read data from files and to represent and handle information with the help of objects.
In this part:

    1. Introduction to object-oriented programming
    2. Objects in a list
    3. Files and reading data
    4. Summary

Part 5

The fifth part of the course material continues with object-oriented programming, which was introduced in the fourth part.
In this part:

    1. Learning object-oriented programming
    2. Removing repetitive code (overloading methods and constructors)
    3. Primitive and reference variables
    4. Objects and references
    5. Conclusion

Part 6

The sixth part of the course material handles objects consisting of objects, and we'll take a look at separating the text user interface and the program logic.
In this part:

    1. Objects on a list and a list as part of an object
    2. Separating the user interface from program logic
    3. Introduction to testing
    4. Complex programs

Part 7

In the seventh part of the course we'll focus on general programming paradigms and algorithms. The course Introduction to programming (TKT-10002) ends after the seventh week, and the Advanced course in programming (TKT-10003) begins with the eight part.
In this part:

    1. Programming paradigms
    2. Algorithms
    3. Larger programming exercises
    4. Conclusion

Part 8

in this part:

    1. Short recap
    2. Hash Map
    3. Similarity of objects
    4. Grouping data using hash maps
    5. Fast data fetching and grouping information

Part 9

The ninth part of the course material focuses on two essential concepts of object oriented programming, namely inheritance and interfaces. You will learn to create classes that inherit another classes, and also classes that implement one or more interfaces. You are also going to notice that an object can be represented by any of its actual types.
In this part:

    1. Class inheritance
    2. Interfaces
    3. Object polymorphism
    4. Summary


Part 10

In the tenth part of the course we introduce handling collections with streams. You'll learn how to create a stream from a collection, filter the values of a stream, transform the values of a stream, and collect values of a stream to another collection. We introduce the concept lambda expression, and you'll learn to use it in your programs. You will also learn how to order objects using the Java Comparable interface, and some other useful techniques like regular expressions, enumerate type and iterator.
In this part:

    1. Handling collections as streams
    2. The Comparable Interface
    3. Other useful techniques
    4. Summary


Part 11

In the eleventh part you'll learn to decypher simple class diagrams. You'll become familiar with packages in Java and learn what the different parts of an import statement mean. You'll practise using exceptions in Java: how to throw and handle them. You'll take another look at reading data from a file, and learn to write data to a file.
In this part:

    1. Class diagrams
    2. Packages
    3. Exceptions
    4. Processing files
    5. Conclusion


Part 12

In the twelfth part of the course we will introduce type parameters and you will learn what ArrayList<String>; actually means. You will learn to implement classes that use type parameters. You will get to understand how ArrayList and HashMap are implemented, and you will implement your own versions as well. You will learn how to create random numbers, and practice using some Java tools to create random numbers. You will learn how multidimensional data can be presented, and how to use multidimensional arrays.
In this part:

    1. Type parameters
    2. ArrayList and hash table
    3. Randomness
    4. Multidimensional data
    5. Summary


Part 13

The thirteenth part of the course material introduces the topics of creating graphical user interfaces and the kinds of components that are used in them. You will learn to handle different events that occur in graphical user interfaces, and practise creating applications that contain multiple views.
In this part:

    1. Graphical user interfaces
    2. UI components and their layout
    3. Event handling
    4. Application's launch parameters
    5. Multiple views
    6. Summary


Part 14

In the fourteenth part you will learn methods for data visualization and acquaint yourself with Java's existing charts (line chart, bar chart). You will learn to make simple drawings and take a look at image processing. You will also learn to play audio files. Finally, there is a slightly larger program — the Asteroids game — that you will create by following an example.
In this part:

    1. Data visualization
    2. Multimedia in programs
    3. Larger application: Asteroids
    4. Maven and third-party libraries
    5. Conclusion
